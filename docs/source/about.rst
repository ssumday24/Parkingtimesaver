About the Project
===================

Parktimesaver is an innovative solution designed to address the growing challenge of finding available parking spaces in increasingly crowded urban environments. As parking lots multiply rapidly, the struggle to locate an open spot becomes more pronounced. Our mission at Parktimesaver is to streamline this process, making parking more accessible and less time-consuming.

Our system is uniquely tailored for large parking areas like those at department stores and marts, where finding a parking spot can be a time-consuming ordeal. Moreover, we address the common frustration of waiting in long queues to pay for parking. Parktimesaver's online reservation and payment system not only saves time but also adds convenience to your parking experience.

By introducing a system where you can reserve a parking space at a specific time and pay online within a few hours of using the parking lot, Parktimesaver aims to drastically reduce the time and stress associated with parking.
