## what is parkingtimesaver

When using large parking lots such as department stores and marts, many people visit seats for hours at most to park in the parking lot. Also, people are uncomfortable with long queues to pay when they leave the parking lot after solving their work. To solve this problem, we set the goal of developing a site with a parking lot reservation system that allows you to reserve a seat on a fixed time and a payment window that allows payments to be made online within a few hours of using the parking lot.


## Development Languages
