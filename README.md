### Project information

These days, as parking places are increasing with rapid rate, we have difficulty in finding parking lots that are available. To solve this problem, we have thought about a parking lot reservation system that allows you to reserve a space at a specific time, and a site with a payment window that allows payment online within a few hours of using the parking lot.

### what is parkingtimesaver?

When using large parking lots such as department stores and marts, many people visit seats for hours at most to park in the parking lot. Also, people are uncomfortable with long queues to pay when they leave the parking lot after solving their work. To solve this problem, we set the goal of developing a site with a parking lot reservation system that allows you to reserve a seat on a fixed time and a payment window that allows payments to be made online within a few hours of using the parking lot.

## Start Guide

### Requirements

- Reservation and Availability Check: Drivers can book a parking space for their desired date, time, and location. This enables them to check parking lot availability in advance and reduces the hassle of finding a vacant spot.
- Reservations can be made quickly and easily through our web platform, and users can easily confirm, modify, or cancel their bookings.
- Payment Options: Most parking reservation services offer multiple payment options, allowing drivers to pay for parking fees without cash.
